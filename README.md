# Known Bugs:
1. When using arrow keys to cycle through input history the text that should'nt be deleted gets deleted 
2. When used alone the 'cd' command does nothing rather than take the user back to the their root directory
3. You can seemingly enter an infinite amount of Husk "instances". INCEPTION VIBES
